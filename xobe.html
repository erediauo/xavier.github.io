        <h1>xobe</h1>

        <p>
            xobe is a London-based digital artist working through highly conceptual
            and empathetic approaches to image-making.
        </p>

        <p>
            Their practice is guided by faith, spirituality, and a curiosity around
            the spiritual self. Working intuitively, pieces form through subtle shifts
            in energy, environment, and feeling.
        </p>

        <p>
            Influenced by Gustave Doré, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Asako Narahashi,
            their work blends metaphor, surrealism, and emotional tension to explore
            belief, liminality, and the human condition.

    <!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
    <div class="project-box">
        <h2>INTERFERENCE</h2>

        <p>
            The aim of this project was to interfere with visual perception,
            encouraging viewers to rely on memory and recognition to fill in gaps.
        </p>

        <p>
            These pieces are not complete without audience participation.
            Through engagement, familiar symbols emerge in unfamiliar ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            INTERFERENCE explores uncanny familiarity and challenges the objectivity
            of visual language by revealing its emotional and psychological depth.
